  The SOPCINFO file is created by Qsys during system generation. 
  This database can be used to create system header files and 
  device trees for the software environment.
  The “sopc-create-header-files” utility can generate a variety 
  of header file and macro file formats, and the “sopc2dts” 
  utility can create device trees representing the Qsys system.
